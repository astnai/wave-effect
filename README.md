# Wave effect

This project features a wave effect animation where the characters become increasingly opaque, creating a visually appealing and professional look. The effect uses a monochromatic color scheme derived from black to maintain a modern and minimalist aesthetic.

## development process

This effect was developed through a series of iterations with the help of GPT-4o. A total of 9 prompts were used to refine and perfect the animation, ensuring it is smooth, dynamic, and visually stunning.

## usage

To run the animation, simply execute the script in a Node.js environment:

```bash
node gpt.js
```

## credits

This animation was developed with the assistance of GPT-4o, iterating through multiple prompts to achieve the desired result.
